_Executed with Claude Sonnet 4.5_

- Add a new script that calls #file:count_countries.py with a given input file and then generates all possible combinations of maps via #file:plot_countries.py

- Update #file:generate_maps.py to optionally take a second file input like #file:plot_countries.py. If given, set the title to "My Travel Map" by default

- Do not set any default title. Rely on the default provided by #file:plot_countries.py

- Add an option to use a different file extension
