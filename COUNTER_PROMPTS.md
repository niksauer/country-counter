- Is there a Google Maps API to fetch all locations saved to a private list?

```
No, Google Maps does not provide a public API to fetch locations saved to a user's private lists.

What's available:

- Google Maps API - For embedding maps, geocoding, directions, etc., but not for accessing user's saved places
- Places API - For searching/discovering places, but not for retrieving a user's personal saved lists

Why:

Private lists are part of a user's personal Google account data. Accessing them would require:

- User authentication via OAuth 2.0
- Access to Google's internal user data APIs (not publicly available)

Alternatives:

- Google Takeout - Users can manually export their saved places data
- My Maps API - Can access maps a user has explicitly shared, but not the default "Saved Places" lists
- Manual scraping - Violates Google's TOS and is unreliable

[...]
```

- Given the attached CSV export for Google Takeout, create a script that counts the total number of visited countries.

- Update the script to only use the Google Maps API since the CSV includes links to Google Maps locations which should all have a country set

```
I'll update the script to use the Google Maps API instead of the free geocoding service. Let me first check the current state of the file and then modify it to extract location data from the Google Maps URLs.

Summary of Changes
- Updated to use Google Maps API instead of the free OpenStreetMap service
  - Uses the official Geocoding API which is more reliable and accurate
  - Extracts coordinates from Google Maps URLs when available
  - Falls back to place name geocoding for other cases
  - API Key requirement: The script now requires a GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY environment variable

- Improved caching: Better cache key formatting (6 decimal places for coordinates)

- Faster processing: Reduced delay between API calls from 1 second to 0.1 seconds (Google's rate limits are more generous)

- Better error handling: Added KeyboardInterrupt handling for graceful stops

- How do I obtain an API  key?

- Why does this script return Vietnam as the country for the following link even though visiting it in the browser clearly shows it as being in Germany?

```
[...]

Summary

The issue with your script: The script was extracting "Hanoi" from the URL path and geocoding it, which returned Vietnam, even though the actual location (identified by the hex Place ID) is in Germany.

The problem: Google Maps URLs can have misleading place names in the path. The URL structure /place/Hanoi/ doesn't necessarily mean the location is actually in Hanoi - it might be a search query or outdated information. The real location is identified by the hex Place ID in the data parameter.

The solution I implemented:

- Added detection for hex Place IDs: The script now checks if a URL contains hex identifiers like 1s0x47bd96fbe7bd5665:0xb82c2d0dbd9af2a0

- Improved prioritization: When a URL has hex Place IDs, the script skips place name geocoding and warns about potential mismatches

- Better logging: URLs with potential mismatches are clearly marked with ⚠️ warnings

Result: Your specific URL will now:

- Show a warning: ⚠️ Skipping place name 'Hanoi' (URL has hex ID - potential mismatch)
- Be added to the failed lookups for manual review
- Not incorrectly return "Vietnam" as the country

This prevents false results while flagging cases that need manual attention. For URLs like yours, you would need to manually verify the actual location by visiting the URL in a browser, as you did.
```

- Which API is needed to lookup the hex ID?

```
[...]

Recommended Approach

Given the complexity and uncertainty around hex Place ID conversion, I'd recommend keeping the current solution I implemented, which:

- Detects potential mismatches when hex Place IDs are present
- Skips unreliable place name geocoding for such URLs
- Flags them for manual review

This prevents incorrect results (like your "Hanoi → Vietnam" issue) while acknowledging that some locations will need manual verification.

If you really want to pursue automatic resolution of hex Place IDs, you would need to:

- Enable the Google Places API in your Google Cloud Console
- Experiment with whether the API accepts hex format Place IDs
- Potentially research if there's a conversion method from hex to standard Place ID format

But honestly, the manual review approach is probably more reliable and cost-effective for your use case.
```

- Try using the new Google Places API for only this URL

```
[...]

Key Findings

The APIs didn't reject the hex Place ID format - they failed due to API permissions/enablement issues, not because of the Place ID format itself. This suggests the hex format might actually be supported!

Next Steps

To properly test this, you would need to:

- Enable the Places API (New) in your Google Cloud Console:

  - Visit: https://console.developers.google.com/apis/api/places.googleapis.com/overview?project=246798676389
  - Enable the API

- Or enable the legacy Places API if you prefer that approach

The test script is ready to run once you enable the appropriate API. The fact that both APIs responded with permission errors rather than "invalid place ID" errors is actually encouraging - it suggests the hex format might work!

[...]
```

- I have enabled both APIs now

```
[...]

Conclusion

The hex Place ID format (0x47bd96fbe7bd5665:0xb82c2d0dbd9af2a0) from Google Maps URLs is not supported by Google's public Places APIs. These are internal Google identifiers that cannot be used with the public APIs.

This confirms that the current approach in your script is correct:

- Detect URLs with hex Place IDs ✓
- Skip place name geocoding for these URLs ✓
- Flag them for manual review ✓

The hex Place IDs are internal to Google Maps and there's no public API to convert them to usable Place IDs or coordinates.

- Does this post on decoding the hex ID help at all? https://stackoverflow.com/questions/44843934/get-lat-lon-from-google-maps-url-ftid-hex

```
[...]

Excellent! This Stack Overflow post provides very valuable information. Let me create a solution based on the approaches mentioned there. The key insights are:

The second hex value (after the colon) can be converted to a Customer ID (CID)
You can use this CID with Google Maps URLs to get coordinates

Two main approaches: URL scraping or Places API with CID parameter

```

- Please integrate this into the main script

- Update the script to also count the states when located in the US

- Ignore the cache if it doesn't include the US state

- Migrate the cache to the new format and remove all US entries

- Make sure that this migration is only run once by adding a `schema_id` property to `cache.json`. Also update the code to always expect the latest schema. Do not support old formats.

- Add a `--silent` flag that hides the live processing output

- Make `--silent` the default

- Output another file that tracks the failed lookups

- Update the script to accept any CSV file path. The cache should be loaded based on the CSV file name, e.g. `Reiseziele.csv` -> `cache/Reiseziele.json`

```
[...]

Summary

I've successfully updated the count_visited_countries.py script to:

- Accept any CSV file path as a command-line argument - The script now requires a CSV file path as a positional argument instead of hardcoding Visited.csv.

- Generate cache files based on CSV filename - The cache naming convention now works as follows:

  - Reiseziele.csv → Reiseziele.json and cache/Reiseziele_failed_lookups.json
  - Visited.csv → Visited.json and Visited_failed_lookups.json

Any other CSV file follows the same pattern

- Create cache directory automatically - The script creates a cache directory if it doesn't exist.

- Handle both relative and absolute paths - The script works correctly whether you provide a relative path like Visited.csv or an absolute path like /full/path/to/Reiseziele.csv.

- Updated documentation - Changed the script description and docstring to reflect that it can handle any CSV file with location data, not just Google Takeout exports.

- Error handling - The script properly checks if the CSV file exists and provides clear error messages.

[...]
```

- Share the cache for place ID and coordinate based lookups between all input files. Keep the place name based lookups isolated to each input file. Migrate the cache schema and existing files in /cache if necessary.

```
[...]

Benefits:
- Reduced API calls: Place IDs and coordinates found in one CSV file are automatically reused when processing other CSV files
- Isolated place names: Place name lookups remain per-file to avoid ambiguity (e.g., "London" could refer to different locations)
- Efficient storage: Shared cache eliminates duplication of hex/coordinate entries across files
- Backward compatible: Automatic migration from v2 to v3 with backup of old files
The implementation is complete and tested with all three CSV files in your repository!

[...]
```

- Update the script to output the countries and states therein as a JSON file with the following schema, expressed via TypeScript (`type Schema = ({ country: string, states: string[] })[];`). This output should be in addition to the existing console logs.

- Use the new `country_states_map` instead of the `countries` and `states` lists for console outputs

- Replace `country_counts` with `country_states_map`

```
[...]

Actually, I realize you might want me to completely remove country_counts and derive the counts differently. Let me clarify - we still need to count how many locations are in each country. Currently:

- countries list: contains duplicate country names (one per location)
- country_states_map: contains unique countries with their states
- country_counts: counts occurrences in the countries list

We can keep both approaches, or if you want to eliminate the countries list entirely, we'd need to track counts in country_states_map as well. Let me know if you'd like me to refactor this further to avoid maintaining the separate countries list!
```

- Yes, please track counts via `country_states_map`

```
[...]

Benefits:
- Single source of truth: All country data (counts and states) tracked in one structure
- Cleaner code: Eliminated redundant data structures
- Better maintainability: Less chance of inconsistencies between separate lists
- Same functionality: All outputs (console and JSON) work exactly as before
```

- Update the JSON file output to include the `count`

- Move the `countries_json_file` output to the `build/` directory

- Does the Google Maps API response for a location lookup include coordinates? If so, store them in the cache. Add a migration if necessary.

- Update the JSON output to the following schema: `type Schema = ({ country: string, count: number, states: ({ name: string, code: string })[], locations: ({ lat: string, lng: string })[] })[];`
